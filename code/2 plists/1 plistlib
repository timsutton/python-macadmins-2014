# a simple example, but there are other ways to get the OS version without
# having our own code reading a file off disk:
# - in the os module, os.uname()[2] can give us a Darwin kernel version,
#   but this is less readable because kernel '14.0.0' == OS version '10.10.0'
# - the platform module, platform.mac_ver()[0] returns the OS X version like '10.0.0'
