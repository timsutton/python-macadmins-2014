# What's the difference between a method and a function?
# They're functionally the same thing, but typically when
# we refer to a function we're talking about something
# defined within a program/script or a module (for example,
# os.path.join() would be a function provided by the os
# module), but a method is a function defined by a class,
# which we invoke on that object itself. For example,
# "My dog has fleas".split() is an example of calling the
# split() method on a string.
