# help()
#If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console. If the argument is any other kind of object, a help page on the object is generated.

import time
help(time)

# What class is the object so that I could just look it up?
myobj = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}
myobj.__class__

# What attributes belong to an object or module?
import time

# see lots more of these special / magic / 'dunder' methods

# In a script, if you need to make sense of large amounts of data (especially
# dictionaries) use the pprint (pretty-print) module:
# pprint(complicated_dict)

# use ipython! (sudo easy_install ipython)
# - autocomplete for methods
# - passes common shell commands through (cd, man, ls, etc.)
# - nice formatting of objects like dictionaries
# - history, re-using output from previous statements results
